**Retrospective:**
We all collaborated in pairs. Each pair working on one of the three layers (Repository, Service and Controller layer). We had scheduled meetings twice a week, where we discussed all the parts and divided the tasks among us, all of us attended both our in person meetings and after covid struck again we met up on discord for our later meetings. We went over each other's parts giving feedback and oversight for the other pair. That gave everyone a good reflection of what they have done and what the group and pairs have done.
