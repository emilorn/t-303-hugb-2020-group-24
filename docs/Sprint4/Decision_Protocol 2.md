**Monday 13. October:**

First sprint meeting. Fixed some bugs from previous sprint. Discussed DoD and decided to wait for the TA and Scrum meetings to decide a few things. Sent the email to group 25 to get access to their code on GitLab.


**Thursday 14. October:**

Decided on DoD after both meetings and sent to TA. Got email from group 23 for access to our code. 

DoD:
- implement getAllRegions
- implement getCandidatePolicies
- implement getPollPerElection
- code review


**Monday 19. October**

New DoD:
- [ ] implement getAllRegions 
- [ ] implement getAveragePoll
- [ ] implement getElectionDetails
- [ ] implement getPollPerElection
- [ ] code review


Set up a board for Sprint 4 with tasks and started to distribute them amongst group members. 
Looked at the code of group 23 together and distributed which parts each memeber was to review.

**Wednesday 21. October**

Today was mainly debugging the code and finishing touches. The DoD was reached and all functions are green on the frontend. As always the collaboration went well and everyone showed up to meetings and did their parts. This time we split much of the work to individuals but always decided and discussed as a group.
