	- added userstories #20 and #27

**Thursday 1. October:**

Assigned tasks to group members on git and worked seperately on tasks.
Meeting with Shalini and scrum of scrums meeting. 
Decided to focus on finishing the implementations of the websockets for the routes in the interface_h2 before implementing other user stories as websockets.

**Monday 5. October:**

Members tested their parts of the code on given frontend and debugging.

**Wednesday 7. October:**

Retrospective meeting:
Did not manage to implement user story #20 as during the sprint we decided it was more important to finish the websockets for user stories listed in interface_h2. 
Did though finish implementing user story #27 and it is reachable through a websocket interface.

We continued working in pairs and held a group meeting twice a week where we discussed all parts of the current sprint and divided the tasks among us. That gave everyone a good reflection on what was done and what each pair had done.
