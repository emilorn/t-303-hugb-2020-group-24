**Monday 26. October**

A misunderstanding concerning code reviews so most group members needed to redo that. Our understanding was to not have many of us repeting a review on the same files instead do one review together. But that was fixed on monday and each group member that needed to redo a code review did so. The definition of done was decided.
DOD
- implement createCandidate
- video
- textual document
- touch up some test cases


**Thursday 29. October**

Decided to divide tasks among group members as the workload is heavy in all courses during the last weeks of the semester. In teams of two we decided that one team does the video, one team does the textual document and the third team completes the code needed.


**Monday 2. November**

Everyone working on their parts as distributed. We all were in good contact along the way and helped each other if needed.


**Wednesday 4. November**

Meeting to discuss and finish all deliverables along with a retrospective meeting. A few touch ups and grammar checks done on the textual document and similar for the video, few touch ups here and there. Test coverage checked and sufficient statement coverage was achived. Again the sprint went well and each group member delivered their part of doing the work of this sprint.
